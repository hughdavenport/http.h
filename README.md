This repo contains a [stb-style](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/stb_howto.txt) header only library. This library depends on [url.h](https://github.com/hughdavenport/url.h) of atleast version `1.0.0`. Along side that, you need [http.h](https://github.com/hughdavenport/http.h/raw/refs/heads/main/http.h).

This was developed during a [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqw7B6eR9P8&list=PL5r5Q39GjMDfetFdGmnhjw1svsALW1HIY) where I implement [bittorrent from scratch](https://github.com/hughdavenport/codecrafters-bittorrent-c), where [SHA-1](https://github.com/hughdavenport/sha1.h), and [URL parsing](https://github.com/hughdavenport/url.h/raw/refs/heads/main/url.h) and HTTP communication is a necessary component.

To use the library, ensure [url.h](https://github.com/hughdavenport/url.h) has been setup then `#define HTTP_IMPLEMENTATION` exactly once (in your main.c may be a good place). You can `#include` the file as many times as you like.

An example file is shown below.
```c
/* Depends on https://github.com/hughdavenport/url.h for URL parsing */
#define URL_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "url.h"

#define HTTP_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "http.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sysexits.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc < 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s url\n", argv[0]);
        return EX_USAGE;
    }

    HttpUserAgent agent = {         // These options can be set
        .name = NULL,               //  or the argument passed
        .cookie_jar = NULL,         //  as NULL. The library will
    };                              //  do as you expect ;)

    int ret = EX_DATAERR;
    HttpHeaders headers = {0};
    if (!add_http_headers(&headers,
            HTTP_HEADER("X-http-h-version", HTTP_H_VERSION),
            HTTP_HEADER("X-http-h-url", "https://github.com/hughdavenport/http.h")
    )) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Could not add headers\n");
        goto end;
    }
    if (!add_http_headers(&headers,
            HTTP_HEADER("X-http-h-version-major", HTTP_H_VERSION_MAJOR_S),
            HTTP_HEADER("X-http-h-version-minor", HTTP_H_VERSION_MINOR_S),
            HTTP_HEADER("X-http-h-version-patch", HTTP_H_VERSION_PATCH_S)
    )) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Could not add headers\n");
        goto end;
    }

    URL url = {0};
    if (!parse_url(argv[1], argv[1] + strlen(argv[1]), &url)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Invalid URL: %s.\n", argv[1]);
        goto end;
    }

    ret = EX_UNAVAILABLE;
    HttpResponse response = {0};
    if (!send_http_request(&url, &agent, &headers, &response)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error occurred while sending request.\n");
        goto end;
    }

    if (response.body) printf("%s", response.body);

    ret = EX_OK;
end:
    free_http_headers(&headers);
    free_http_response(&response);
    return ret;
}
```

Test by saving the above to a file `example.c` and then running this
```sh
cc example.c
./a.out http://httpbin.org/headers
```

It should give output similar to:
```
Different HTTP minor version 1.1
Content-Length: 379
{
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.81.0",
    "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-67257586-6663a25640d0b042333ba5ee",
    "X-Http-H-Url": "https://github.com/hughdavenport/http.h",
    "X-Http-H-Version": "1.0.0",
    "X-Http-H-Version-Major": "1",
    "X-Http-H-Version-Minor": "0",
    "X-Http-H-Version-Patch": "0"
  }
}
```
